# sweep-128.params
# Parameter sweep configuration for batch simulations.
# Used by runSweepHamilton-serial-128.sbatch by default.
# Sweep: Ec_h only (128 cases), logarithmically spaced from 0.01 to 10 (inclusive)

# ============================================================
# Base Configuration
# ============================================================
# Start from this parameter file and override sweep variables
BASE_CONFIG=default.params

# Optional: simulation source file in simulationCases/
# SOURCE_FILE_NAME=hypha.c

# ============================================================
# Case Number Range
# ============================================================
# Starting case number (4-digit: 1000-9999)
CASE_START=1506

# Ending case number (inclusive)
# 128 cases => CASE_END = CASE_START + 127
CASE_END=1633

# ============================================================
# Sweep Variables
# ============================================================
# Format: SWEEP_<variable>=value1,value2,value3,...
# Here we sweep only Ec_h, so there are exactly 128 combinations.
